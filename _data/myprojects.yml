research: |
  I work at [NICS Lab](https://www.nics.uma.es), an international leading Security research group led by Javier Lopez, Full Professor of the Computer Science Department at the University of Malaga. It is located at the *Ada Byron Research Building*, and its members have participated in more than 50 security research projects at an international and national level. During my doctoral studies, I have had the possibility to contribute in some of these works, which have been published in high-impact journals and international conferences (listed below).

  Among the latest projects financed by the European Union H2020 programme, we can highlight *SealedGRID*, which aims at developing an advanced Smart GRID security platform. Recently, we prepared a video to summarize the different contributions from the University of Malaga.
teaching: |
  Besides my research activities as a Ph.D. student, I have also had the opportunity to give lectures at the University of Malaga, on the subjects of *Wireless Networks* and *Telematic Services Development* (in Spanish), from 2017 to 2020. 
  
  Along with teaching, I have co-directed some dissertations of the main Bachelor's degrees, which were mainly focused on the implementation of *Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)* and secure applications.
development: |
  After working hours, I am always keen to improve my development skills. Apart from Matlab (which I use on a daily basis), I am especially interested in Node.js projects, Blockchain technologies and mobile apps. In this sense, I have certain experience using web-based hybrid frameworks such as Cordova or Ionic. 

  I started to be interested in these technologies back in 2014, when I had the chance to enroll in an intership in *Seis Cocos*, a company from Malaga focused on web and mobile development. This knowledge was also reflected on my Bachelor's Thesis, a continuous authentication protocol based on wireless devices with Bluetooth Low Energy. That also helped a lot to click my mind and grow my interest in the cyber-security area.
